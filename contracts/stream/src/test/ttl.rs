//! Stage 3 — TTL, rent, and archival.
//!
//! This is the file that separates a production streaming primitive from a
//! hackathon one. A stream running twelve months outlives its initial TTL, and
//! if the entry archives, the recipient's claim becomes unreadable until
//! somebody pays to restore it.
//!
//! # What the test host can and cannot prove
//!
//! The SDK's test host runs storage in *recording* mode, where reading an
//! expired persistent entry triggers `handle_maybe_expired_entry`: the entry is
//! restored in place with its data intact and its TTL reset to
//! `min_persistent_entry_ttl`. That mirrors the on-network outcome of a
//! `RestoreFootprint` operation, so these tests genuinely prove **data survives
//! the archive/restore boundary with balances intact**.
//!
//! What they cannot reproduce is the client-side dance on a real network, where
//! the transaction *fails first* and the caller must resubmit with a restore
//! footprint. That step has no unit-test surface and belongs in the testnet
//! exercise in stage 4.
//!
//! One useful consequence of the host's behaviour: an entry that has been
//! through an auto-restore has a TTL of exactly `min_persistent_entry_ttl - 1`,
//! which is far below anything this contract ever sets. [`was_restored`] uses
//! that as a detector for "this entry archived".

// --- Keeper runner invariant hardening (issue #289) ------------------------
//
// `script/keeper-extend-ttl.sh` drives the permissionless
// `extend_stream_ttl` entry point in a batch loop. The runner must never
// commit state or emit an event for a degenerate input; every rejection has
// to be deterministic and side-effect free. The tests below pin those
// invariants for the three adversarial classes called out in the issue:
//
//   1. zero-duration cliffs (a stream whose schedule length is zero),
//   2. `i128::MAX` deposit rates (arithmetic that would silently wrap), and
//   3. same-ledger state transitions (a sweep that lands on the ledger the
//      stream was created on, where no rent has burned yet).
//
// Each case asserts three things: a deterministic error, no mutation of the
// persisted stream, and no event emission.

/// touch. Comparing two snapshots proves "no state mutation" without relying
/// on the runner's own bookkeeping.
