//! Storage access and TTL management.
//!
//! # Why TTL is the hard part
//!
//! Soroban persistent entries have a time-to-live measured in ledgers. When it
//! runs out the entry is archived and becomes unreadable until explicitly
//! restored. A stream running twelve months will outlive its default TTL.
//!
//! If a stream entry archives the tokens are *not* lost — they sit in the
//! contract's pooled balance — but the accounting entry saying who they belong to
//! is inaccessible until someone pays to restore it. For a payroll or grant
//! primitive that is unacceptable, so the contract engineers around it three
//! ways:
//!
//! 1. **Extend after every successful mutation.** Stream state is serialized
//!    once, then its TTL is extended once to the new schedule target. Pure
//!    reads do not write or extend TTL.
//! 2. **Extend generously at creation**, targeting the stream's remaining
//!    lifetime plus a buffer, clamped to the network maximum.
//! 3. **Permissionless top-ups** via `extend_stream_ttl`, so a keeper —or the
//!    recipient, or any passer-by — can keep a claim readable without the
//!    sender's cooperation.
//!
//! # Instance vs persistent TTL policy
//!
//! The contract uses two Soroban storage lifetimes, and they are *not* managed
//! the same way:
//!
//! | Entry | Lifetime | TTL target | Who bumps it |
//! |-------|----------|-----------|--------------|
//! | [`DataKey::NextStreamId`] and [`DataKey::StreamCount`] | **instance** | always the network `max_ttl()` | every mutating call |
//! | [`DataKey::Stream(id)`] (a stream) | **persistent** | remaining life + [`TTL_BUFFER_SECONDS`], floored at [`MIN_STREAM_TTL_LEDGERS`] | mutation + keeper |
//! | [`DataKey::Delegate(id, address)`] | **persistent** | network `max_ttl()` | grant creation + use |
//!
//! **Instance entries are always kept at maximum rent.** They are tiny, and the
//! id counter carries the contract's monotonicity invariant: if `NextStreamId`
//! archived, the next `create_stream` would restart ids from zero and collide
//! with live streams. So [`extend_instance`] pins it to `max_ttl()` on *every*
//! mutating call — creation, every withdrawal, every pause, every keeper sweep.
//!
//! **Persistent entries target the stream's remaining lifetime.** They hold the
//! full accounting record, so active streams target a window that covers their
//! scheduled end plus a keeper buffer. Terminal streams target the floor of
//! [`MIN_STREAM_TTL_LEDGERS`] so final state stays readable. Soroban only
//! extends TTLs; an existing entry may remain above a reduced target until its
//! extra TTL naturally decays.
//!
//! **Ordering guarantee.** [`DataKey::NextStreamId`] must *never* expire before
//! the streams it issued. Because the instance entry is always pinned to the
//! maximum while a persistent entry is only ever as long-lived as its target,
//! the instance entry is always at least as fresh as any stream — so a live
//! stream can never outlive its own id-counter, and a keeper sweep always
//! bumps both in the same transaction ([`extend_stream_ttl`] calls
//! [`extend_stream`] *and* [`extend_instance`] together).
//!
//! # Safe handling of each storage type
//!
//! - **Instance `NextStreamId`** is read with a fallback of `0` (a fresh
//!   contract), written monotonically, and always re-extended. A restored
//!   instance correctly resumes from the last persisted id, never reusing one.
//! - **Persistent `Stream(id)`** is read through [`load_stream`] or
//!   [`peek_stream`], neither of which writes. State writes extend the stream
//!   once after serialization; [`stream_exists`] checks presence without
//!   decoding the accounting record.
//!
//! The regression tests in `test/ttl.rs` exercise both lifetimes from seeded
//! ledger states and assert that the instance entry cannot expire before the
//! persistent entries it issued.
